- **Align maps consistently** when creating multiple maps of the same area
- **Note magnetic vs. true north** if relevant for your location

### Symbols & Legend
**Standard Mapping Symbols:**
- **Trees:** Circles with different sizes for different species/ages
- **Shrubs:** Smaller circles or clusters

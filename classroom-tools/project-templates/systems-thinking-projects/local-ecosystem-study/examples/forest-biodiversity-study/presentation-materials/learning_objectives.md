# Learning Objectives: Forest Biodiversity Study

## Primary Learning Goals

### Systems Thinking Competencies
Students will develop the ability to:
- **Understand Interconnections**: Recognize how forest components (flora, fauna, abiotic factors) interact within complex ecosystems
- **Identify Feedback Loops**: Observe how changes in one ecosystem component affect others through various feedback mechanisms
- **Analyze Hierarchical Levels**: Examine biodiversity from genetic, species, and ecosystem perspectives
- **Recognize Emergent Properties**: Understand how ecosystem-level properties emerge from species interactions

### Scientific Investigation Skills
Students will be able to:
- **Design Field Studies**: Plan systematic approaches to biodiversity assessment using appropriate sampling methods
- **Collect and Analyze Data**: Gather quantitative biodiversity data and calculate relevant indices (Shannon, Simpson, evenness)
- **Use Scientific Tools**: Apply identification keys, measurement instruments, and data recording protocols
- **Interpret Results**: Draw evidence-based conclusions about ecosystem health and biodiversity patterns

### Ecological Understanding
Students will demonstrate knowledge of:
- **Species Diversity Concepts**: Define and distinguish between richness, evenness, and diversity indices
- **Habitat Relationships**: Explain how different species depend on specific habitat characteristics
- **Ecological Succession**: Understand how forest communities change over time
- **Human Impact Assessment**: Evaluate anthropogenic effects on forest biodiversity

### Data Literacy and Analysis
Students will master:
- **Statistical Analysis**: Calculate and interpret biodiversity indices and their significance
